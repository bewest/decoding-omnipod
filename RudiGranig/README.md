I got this files from Rudi Granig and he allowed that I share them in 
effort to get omnipod decoded...


This are relevant Omnipod files:

1.) *.ibf 
This is data image of all data on pump, it is visible when attaching
device to USB.

2.) report.pdf
This is printed report which contains all data entries that were read 
from pump. There is currently only one software which can import .ibf 
file (myLife version of Diabass*) and software is about as useless it can 
be and export of data is useless (no pump data) for our purposes,
so I did detailed report of all data entries... 


*
I have evaluation version of this software (about 65 Mb), if someone 
needs it to experiment with it...
